# Patrick Bateman

This website is a inspired by the character Patrick Bateman from the movie American Psycho. In the movie, Bateman goes in to great detail on his personal tastes and styles. The movie is set in 1987. This website brings the styles and tastes (Music, Wellness and Restaurants) into the future, almost as if it were written by Bateman himself.

## UX

This website is built for fans of the movie American Psycho.

The websites font and colours are based on Patrick Batemans business card. In the movie, Bateman goes in to great detail on the texture, font, font weight and colouring of his, and his associates, business cards. A sample of his business card is available within the wireframe folder for comparison. 
The websites 4 pages are all built to delight the fans of American Psycho. On the Homepage there is a toggle button that switches Patrick Batemans headshot and job title to something more fitting to his dual personality (as displayed throughout the movie). This is an easter egg for fans.
Patrick Bateman goes to great length to describe his personal tastes and style. The wellness page is derived from his opening monologue in the movie. His taste in music is potrayed a number of times and the Music section of this website compiles all of his tastes and views on the matter. The Restaurants page has reviews for 3 restaurants, all of them Dorsia. Bateman often refers to Dorsia in the movies and it is seen as the pinacle of fine dining in New York City. Getting a booking at Dorsia is seen as the ultimate flaunt in his social circles. This is highlighted 5 times in the film. while it was not my intention to submit Lorem Ipsum text on this project I did not have the creativity within my time constraints to write reviews on fictious restaurants. I felt anything that did not match the tone and snobbery of Bateman would subtract from the users experience on the site. All 3 reviews are however meant to be Dorsia, to drive home Batemans obesession with the restuarant.

### Features Left to Implement
- Spotify / YouTube Links. In the future I would like to add Spotify / Youtube Links to the music page and to each artists top track/ top referenced track within the review. I had added styling for these in this version but removed them as they required JavaScript for functionality.
- Product links. On the wellness page I wouild like to add links to products that Patrick Bateman may use. Again this required JS to complete as wanted in this version.
- Bateman Mode/ Psycho Mode button JS. I would like to change the functionality of the Bateman Mode/ Psycho Mode button. Currently it navigates to a new page html page however I would like to use JS to switch the images and text on the same page.
